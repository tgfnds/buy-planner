  Bugs:

    Align the buttons to the right of the item name.
    ☐ Cannot add ',' or '.' to values.
    Change how validation works to use maybe the Number() validation from
    typescript. This might be better than use the pattern attribute.

  Changes:
    ☐ Think about a name change to the project.
    ☐ Change List to Table.
    Think about this.
